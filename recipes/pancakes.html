    <p><em>Simple, soft, fluffy pancakes, an essential that everyone should know. Youâ€™ve been good all week. Go on.
      You deserve freshly made homemade pancakes for breakfast tomorrow!</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups / 300g plain / all purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 cup / 55g white sugar (caster / super fine is best but not essential)</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups / 435 ml cups milk (any type, any fat %)</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract or essence</li>
      <li>4 tsp butter , for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl, whisk to combine.</li>
      <li>Add egg, milk and vanilla. Whisk until lump free - no longer than 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Heat a non stick skillet - use medium heat if you have a strong stove, medium high if you have a weak one. Add a tiny bit of butter (about 1/2 tsp) and swirl to melt. Use paper towel to mostly wipe the butter off (this is the trick to avoid a dodgy 1st pancake).</li>
      <li>Pour 1/4 cup batter into the middle of the fry pan (I use a slightly heaped ice cream scoop with lever, standard is 1/4 cup).</li>
      <li>Swirl pan lightly to spread or use the ice cream scoop edge to spread into 11cm / 4.5" circle (ruler is a must) (joking!).</li>
      <li>When bubbles rise to the surface (see video), flip and cook the other side until golden.</li>
      <li>Remove and keep warm in a low oven.</li>
      <li>Use more butter every 2 to 3 pancakes - depends how good your non stick coating is.</li>
      <li>Serve with toppings of choice!</li>
    </ol>
