        <li><h4>Dought</h4></li>
        <p>Add the <stron>yeast</stron> to the lukewarm <strong>water</strong> and dissolve.
            Put the <strong>wheat flour, 00 flour, durum wheat semolina</strong> and <stron>salt</stron>
            in the mixing bowl of the food processor and let knead
            with the dough hook on the lowest speed.</p>
        <p>Gradually add the yeast water. Then add the oil as well.
            Let the dough knead for at least 7 minutes. The longer,
            the better.</p>
        <p>Once the dough has a nice smooth surface and there are no more dough scraps hanging
            from the mixing bowl, turn off the machine.
            Release the dough from the hook, shape it into a ball and return it to the bowl.
            Cover with a cloth and let rest for at least 2 hours.</p>
        <li><h4>Tomato sauce</h4></li>
        <p>Put the strained tomatoes, salt, pepper, olive oil and
            oregano in a bowl and mix thoroughly.</p>
        <li><h4>Topping</h4></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 250째C (500째F) top/bottom heat.</p>
        <p>Fray the mozzarella into small pieces with your hands or cut into slices.</p>
        <p>Roll out each piece of dough on a floured work surface and then transfer to a baking sheet.
            Pour some of the tomato sauce on top and spread evenly. Leave about 1cm of the edge free.
            Top generously with mozzarella. Then spread the finely sliced salami on top.</p>
        <p>Then bake for about 10 minutes at 250째C (500째F) top/bottom heat on the lowest rack.</p>
        <p>Remove the pizza from the oven after baking, sprinkle with a little oregano, serve immediately and enjoy hot.
